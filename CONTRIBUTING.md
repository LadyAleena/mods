# Contributing to Lady Aleena's modules

This is a working directory where I am learning what I need to rewrite in the modules, how to write tests, and more. If you see something questionable, please open an [issue](issues) to tell me about it.

## I welcome...

- code fixes
- documentation rewrite suggestions
- "How come" questions
- git usage suggestions

Basically anything that will make my code and documentation better that is clearly written and explained.

## I will not tolerate

I will not tolerate any suggestion that is along the lines of "Use <something>." without an explanation and a relevant code sample. Too many people have told me to use various modules and other things over the years without any explanation or relevant code samples for me to study. If I am told to use something and "read the f...ing manual", or "rtfm" for short, I will ignore the suggestion as I will have no context.

## Note

When I figure out how to package modules and when modules are packaged, they will be removed from this repository into their new packages. Each module in this repository will, at some point, have its own package and repository.
