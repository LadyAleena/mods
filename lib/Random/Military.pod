=head1 DESCRIPTION

The functions of Random::Military will return a hash with the statistics of the selected military unit. The larger the military, the larger and deeper the hash will be. C<random_military> and C<random_military_by_location> must be imported into your script.

The hash for each unit and any subunits will include the leader of the unit, the amount of each subordinate type, and the total amount of soldiers in the unit. To see the full unit, use your favorite data dumping module.
