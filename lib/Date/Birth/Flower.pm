=head1 VERSION

This document describes Date::Birth::Flower version 1.0.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Date::Birth::Flower returns the birth flower associated with months when you use C<birth_flower>. C<birth_flower> needs to be imported into your script. It returns the birth flower associated with the month and country entered. There are currently only two countries with birth flowers, the US and the UK, as far as I know.

Date::Birth::Flower requires Perl version 5.10.0 or better to run.
